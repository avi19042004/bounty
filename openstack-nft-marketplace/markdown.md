# NFT Marketplace Project
## Introduction
In this project, we will be developing a decentralized NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplace using Solidity for the smart contract and a frontend web application for user interaction. The goal of the project is to implement basic and advanced functionalities within the NFT marketplace and create a seamless user experience.

## Basic Functionalities
Our Solidity smart contract will include the following basic functionalities:

1. Connect Wallet: Users will be able to connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the NFT marketplace. This will allow them to interact with the marketplace and perform actions like listing and purchasing NFTs.

2. List NFTs for Sale: Sellers can list their NFTs for sale on the marketplace. Each listing will include details about the NFT, such as its title, description, price, and any other relevant information.

3. Purchase NFTs: Buyers will have the ability to purchase NFTs that are listed for sale. The smart contract will handle the transfer of ownership and the payment of the specified price.

## Additional Functionalities
Beyond the basic requirements, we will implement more advanced features to enhance the NFT marketplace:

1. Bidding System: Introduce a bidding system for NFTs, allowing buyers to place bids on listed NFTs. The highest bid will be accepted after a specified duration, creating an engaging auction-like experience.

2. Wallet NFT View: Users can view the NFTs owned by a particular wallet. This feature provides transparency and enables users to showcase their collection.

3. Bulk Listing and Purchasing: Implement the option to bulk list multiple NFTs for sale simultaneously and allow buyers to purchase multiple NFTs in a single transaction.

4. Activity Feed: Create an activity feed that displays past sales, bids, and other relevant actions within the marketplace. This enhances the social aspect of the platform.

## Web Application
For the frontend, we will develop a web application that interacts with the deployed smart contract:

1. The frontend will allow users to connect their wallets to the marketplace.
2. Users can browse through listed NFTs, view details, and make purchases or bids.
3. Sellers can create new NFT listings and manage their existing listings.
4. The activity feed will be displayed, showcasing recent transactions and bids.
5. A user-friendly interface will ensure a seamless experience for both buyers and sellers.

The web application will be built using React, a popular frontend development framework. Once completed, the web app will be hosted on a platform such as Firebase, Vercel, or Netlify.

## Unit Tests
While not mandatory, we will also write unit tests for our smart contract using the Hardhat testing framework. These tests will ensure the correctness and robustness of our contract's functionality. Writing tests will earn us bonus points and contribute to the overall quality of the project.

In conclusion, this project involves the development of a decentralized NFT marketplace with both basic and advanced functionalities. By combining a Solidity smart contract, a React frontend, and rigorous testing, we aim to create a feature-rich and user-friendly platform for NFT enthusiasts.
